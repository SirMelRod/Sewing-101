        <p>This site will teach you the three basic finishes that should be applied to a finished garment, a few simple but necessary sewing terms and the items you will need to preform the finishes.
        </p>
        <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
        <h3>Fabric traits</h3>
        <p><i>Selvage:</i> a factory finished edge that keeps the fabric from fraying.</p>
        
        <p><i>Raw edge:</i> the cut or an un-finished edge of fabric.</p>
        <h3>Grain: refers to the direction of the threads in woven fabric.</h3>
        <p><i>Straight Grain - Lengthwise - warp:</i> the length of the fabric that runs along the selvage.</p>
        <p><i>Cross grain - widthwise - weft:</i>the width of the fabric that runs along the raw edge of the fabric.</p>
        <p><i>Bias grain - diagonal:</i>runs at an angle between the length and crosswise grains.</p>
        <p><i>Seam:</i>the joining of two pieces of cloth by sewing usually near the edge.</p>  
        <p><i>Seam allowance:</i>is the area between the edges of the fabric and stitching line. Home sewing seam allowance will normally be 5/8" but it can go as low as 1/4".</p>  
        <p><i>Seam finish:</i>a treatment that secures and neatens the raw edges of a seam to prevent the fabric from raveling or fraying.</p>
        <p><i>Stitch length:</i>the length of each individual stitch. Standard stitch length is 2.5mm.</p>
        <p><i>Basting:</i>temporary, long running stitches created by hand or machine 5mm) to hold fabric in place before final stitching.</p>
        <p><i>Melding</i> stitches "set" or becoming part of the fabric by pressing in the direction in which the seam was sewn.</p>
        <p><i>Bust the seam:</i>press seam open.</p>
        <h2> Equipment</h2>
<ol class="a">
  <li>Sewing Shears</li>
  <li>Rotary Cutter and Mat</li>
  <li>Pinking Shears</li>
  <li>Machine Needles</li>
  <li>Bobbin and Thread</li>
  <li>Pins</li>
  <li>Tweezers</li>
  <li>Seam Ripper</li>
  <li>Iron</li>
  <li>Fabric</li>
  <li>Sewing Machine</li>
  <li>Serger</li>
</ol>
        <h2>Seam Finishes</h2>
        <p>To Start off with we will be stitching all of the samples with a <i>Straight Stitch</i>, a 5/8" <i>Seam Allowance</i> and making sure to <i>Bust</i> and <i>Meld</i> the seams.</p>
        <h3>Pinked Finish</h3>
        <p>To do a pinked finish all you need is Pinking Shears, and you simple cut the edges of your seam allowance. (make sure to keep a safe distance from your seam stitch.)</p>
        <h3>Serged Finish</h3>
        <p>The Serged finish is made by using a machine called the Serger this machines only purpose is to finish fabrics. To use you simple place fabric under presser foot and press on the floor peddle, the machine will begin to feed your fabric through cutting off the edge of your fabric and creating a neat and sturdy finish.(this Machine is Not necessary for home sewing)</p>
        <h3>Machine Double Overlock Stitch</h3>
        <p>The Machine Double Overlock Stitch is a setting that come with most of the home sewing machine the method to activate it is different with every machine make sure to look through you machine guild to know what setting to use. This stitch is very similar to the stitch made by the serger only differnce is that it's not as clean. To use this stitch simply press the right setting on your machine (mine happens to be 14 most machine will automatically set appropriate stitch length and needle position) and stitch along the edge of your seam allowance.</p>
        <h3>Zig-Zag Finish</h3>
        <p>All home sewing machines come with this stitch setting programed in(my machines' is 3). The same rules and method is used as in Double Overlock Stitch, but zig-zag stitch is easier and uses less thread to use.</p>
